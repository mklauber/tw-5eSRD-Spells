type: Spell

You and up to eight willing creatures within range&nbsp;project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the&nbsp;spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already&nbsp;on that plane). 
The material body you leave behind is&nbsp;unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it&nbsp;doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.&nbsp;

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in&nbsp;almost every way, replicating your game statistics and&nbsp;possessions. The principal difference is the addition of&nbsp;a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder&nbsp;blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after&nbsp;1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As&nbsp;long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way&nbsp;home. If the cord is cut something that can happen&nbsp;only when an effect specifically states that it does your&nbsp;soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.&nbsp;

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral&nbsp;Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any&nbsp;other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the&nbsp;plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and&nbsp;possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing&nbsp;you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.&nbsp;Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage&nbsp;or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your&nbsp;physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.&nbsp;The spell ends for you and your companions when&nbsp;you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,&nbsp;the affected creature returns to its physical body,&nbsp;and it awakens.&nbsp;

The spell might also end early for you or one of your&nbsp;companions. A successful dispel magic spell used&nbsp;against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that&nbsp;creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form&nbsp;drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If&nbsp;the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls&nbsp;the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its&nbsp;state of suspended animation.&nbsp;If you are returned to your body prematurely, your&nbsp;companions remain in their astral forms and must find&nbsp;their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping&nbsp;to 0 hit points.
