You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range.
If the target can hear you (thought it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
