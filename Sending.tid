You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, regonizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
